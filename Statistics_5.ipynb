    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Estimation statistics is a branch of inferential statistics that involves making educated guesses or estimates about population\n",
    "parameters based on sample data. When it is not feasible or practical to measure an entire population, statisticians use sampl-\n",
    "ing techniques to collect data from a subset of the population. Estimation allows us to draw conclusions about the entire popul-\n",
    "ation using this sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of estimates in estimation statistics: point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate:\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that serves as the best guess for the unknown population parameter. It is obtained by using a\n",
    "statistic calculated from the sample data that is assumed to be a reasonable representation of the population parameter. Common\n",
    "point estimates include the sample mean, sample proportion, sample median, and sample variance, among others. For example, if \n",
    "you want to estimate the average height of all students at a school, you can calculate the sample mean height of a random sample\n",
    "of students and use it as the point estimate for the population mean height.\n",
    "However, it's important to note that point estimates do not give any information about the precision or uncertainty associated \n",
    "with the estimate. This is where interval estimates come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate:\n",
    "An interval estimate is a range of values within which the population parameter is expected to lie, along with a degree of conf-\n",
    "idence in the estimate. It provides a measure of uncertainty associated with the point estimate. The interval estimate is typic-\n",
    "ally expressed as a confidence interval. A confidence interval consists of two numbers: a lower bound and an upper bound.\n",
    "For example, if a 95% confidence interval for the average height of students at a school is 160 cm to 165 cm, it means that we \n",
    "are 95% confident that the true population mean height lies within this range. The wider the confidence interval, the less cert-\n",
    "ain we are about the estimate; whereas, a narrower interval indicates a more precise estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimates take into account both the variability in the sample data and the sample size. As the sample size increases, \n",
    "the interval tends to become narrower, indicating increased precision in the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, estimation statistics involves using sample data to make educated guesses about population parameters. Point estima-\n",
