    "The assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Sampling: The samples must be selected randomly from the population of interest. Each observation in the sample should be\n",
    "    independent of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Size: The sample size should be sufficiently large. While there is no strict rule for what constitutes a \"large\" sample \n",
    "    size, as a general guideline, a sample size of 30 or more is often considered adequate for the CLT to hold, though it may \n",
    "    vary depending on the original distribution's characteristics.\n",

    "Identically Distributed: The samples should be drawn from the same population, and each sample should have the same underlying \n",

    "Under these assumptions, the Central Limit Theorem ensures that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximat-\n",
