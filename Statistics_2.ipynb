    "Ans:\n",
    "The mean, median, and mode are three different measures of central tendency used to describe the typical or central value in a \n",

    "The mean is the average value of a dataset.\n",

    "The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) in the dataset, which can significantly impact its value.\n",
    "It is often used when dealing with interval or ratio data, where numerical operations are meaningful.\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are ordered from smallest to largest (or vice versa).\n",
    "If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is simply the middle value.\n",
    "If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "The median is not influenced by extreme values and is often preferred when there are outliers or the data is skewed.\n",
    "It is commonly used when dealing with ordinal or interval data.\n",
    "Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "A dataset may have one mode (unimodal) if one value occurs most often, or it can have more than one mode (bimodal, trimodal, \n",
    "etc.) if multiple values have the same highest frequency of occurrence.\n",
    "The mode is especially useful for categorical data or nominal data, where values are discrete categories or labels.\n",
    "In summary, the mean is influenced by all the values in the dataset and is commonly used with interval or ratio data, the median\n",

    "\n",
    "Which measure to use for central tendency depends on the data type, distribution, and the research question or objective of the \n",

    "A Venn diagram is a graphical representation used to visualize the relationships and similarities between different sets or \n",
    "groups of items. It was introduced by the English mathematician and logician John Venn in the 19th century. The diagram consists\n",
    "of overlapping circles or ellipses, where each circle represents a set, and the overlapping regions show the elements that \n",

    "sets being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of a Venn diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "Circles (or ellipses): Each circle in the diagram represents a set. The elements of a specific set are contained within the \n",
    "    boundary of the corresponding circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overlapping regions: The overlapping areas between circles show the elements that are shared by two or more sets. The size of\n",
    "    the overlapping region corresponds to the number of elements common to the sets it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-overlapping regions: The parts of each circle that do not intersect with other circles represent elements unique to that \n",

    "Venn diagrams are commonly used in various fields, including mathematics, statistics, logic, and data analysis. They are \n",

    "Units of Measurement:\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance is expressed in the units of the two variables being measured. Therefore, it is not a standardized measu-\n",

    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance alone does not provide a clear indication of the strength or direction of the relationship between the \n",

    "Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example. \n",

    "notable impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "Mean: Outliers can substantially influence the mean because the mean is calculated by summing up all data points and dividing by\n",
    "    the total number of data points. When an outlier is much larger or smaller than the other data points, it can shift the mean\n",
    "    in the direction of the outlier, making it an unreliable representation of the typical value in the dataset.\n",
    "Median: The median is less affected by outliers. It is the middle value in a dataset when the data points are ordered. Since the\n",

    "    present.\n",
    "Mode: The mode, which represents the most frequently occurring value, is not influenced by outliers. Outliers do not impact the \n",

    "\n",
    "In this dataset, the score \"120\" is an outlier as it deviates significantly from the rest of the scores. Let's calculate the\n",

    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "Range: Outliers can have a significant impact on the range because the range is the difference between the largest and smallest \n",
